<p>PulseShield was founded in October 2021 to help with having easy access for self-defense items for those that need it. We ship throughout the United States and to Canada. PulseShield strives to provide quality products at an affordable price. There is a wide variety of items, ranging from different prices and colors. With these self defense items ranging from pepper spray to compact stunguns citizens can ensure their safety when they are walking around in unsafe areas such as alleyways and other areas within the city limits. </p>
<p>Founder and Owner Vijay Barona, a IUPUI student realized there was a need for these items, though wanted to provide a high quality product, but at a cost that could be affordable to everyone, including college students. This idea came to him early 2021 as a junior at IUPUI. With experience living on campus and even hearing about stuff that happens to college students on the news and even outside of college campuses, something needed to be accessible for those that want to protect themselves in a scary situation. </p>
